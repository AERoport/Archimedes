1. Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EasyMock class extension is built with ant. 
Maven is only used to make the project available in the maven repository (http://www.ibiblio.org/maven2).

I'm personnally using ant 1.7.0 and maven 2.0.7 but lower versions might also work.


2. Build a complete release
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First create a lib directory in which you should all dependency jars. Check in the pom.xml for list and
versions. You will also need the latest clover jar with a valid license to be in the lib directory.

If you look in the build.xml, you will see a bunch of, I think, self-explanatory goals. Basically, to
build a complete release, just call the default one (just type "ant" in a cmd.exe from EasyMock class
extension root directory.


3. Release in maven repository
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Call a special ant goal named "maven packaging". The bundle will be created in the project directory
